Issue Type,Summary,Severity,Description,User Journey
bug,1.1: Text Alternatives,1,There were several unlabeled images on the homepage.
bug,1.2: Time-based Media,1,Time-based media was not tested.
bug,1.3: Adaptable,1,There was no heading for the booking content section on the homepage.  There was no heading for the cart content section of the page, once tickets had been added to the cart.  The button to proceed to checkout was located at the bottom of the page below all of the train listings, which was not intuitive.   The button to proceed to the checkout was labeled as "Continue to Next Page" which was not intuitive, and could be confusing as it was located immediately below the pagination links for the train listings content.  If the "Modify Trip" link was selected, there was no information on the page to select a seat. 
bug,1.4: Distinguishable,1,Audio content was not tested, and as a screen reader user, I am not able to comment on the visual content.
bug,2.1: Keyboard Accessible,1,The departure/arrival station fields were not accessible using arrow navigation.  The "Purchase Trip" button was not available in order to complete the transaction.  When the "Trip Tools" button was selected, JAWS indicated to use the space bar followed by the arrow keys to navigate, which when performed did not allow me to navigate.
bug,2.2: Enough Time,1,There were no time constraints on this user flow.
bug,2.3: Seizures,1,I am a screen reader user, and cannot comment on visual content.
bug,2.4: Navigable,1,The button to add passengers is located in the tab order after the "Find Tickets" button.  The buttons to increment/decrement passenger category numbers were not labeled.  There were several unlabeled buttons on the passenger information page.  On the payment page, after selecting the insurance choice, focus was moved to the payment information section of the page. However, this bypassed a check box to accept the terms and conditions.  It was not clear that the "Add" button had to be used in order to complete the transaction.  If the "Trip Tools" button was selected, the choices in the menu were not in the tab order.    
bug,2.5: Input Modalities,1,N/A
bug,3.1 Readable,1,The language of all pages were able to be read by JAWS with no issues.   
bug,3.2 Predictable,1,While populating the departure and arrival station fields, the availability of a listing of suggested stations was inconsistent.
bug,3.3 Input Assistance,1,There was no error reporting on the payment page where the disabled "Purchase Trip" button was available.
bug,4.1: Compatible,1,The "One Way" button was not labeled as a menu.  The fields for the departure/arrival stations are not initially labeled as edit fields e.g. departure station was read by JAWS as a check box.  When a button for a fare was selected, the button did not indicate that it was selected.  When the trip Tools button was expanded all choices in the menu were read twice, sometimes they both read as buttons, and other times, one of the choices would be read as a link.
